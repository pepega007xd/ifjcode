# IFJcodeXX interpreter

Very shitty, i was lazy to do the rest of instructions, and i basically did
not test the thing. But all the interpreter mechanics are implemented, the
only thing left to do are the boring instructions, like 50 slightly different
arithmetic or comparison instructions, string instructions, type casts, etc.

I promise i will return to this and complete it, when i have more time :kappa:
